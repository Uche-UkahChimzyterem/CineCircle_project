# Cinecircle

Cinecircle is a sleek movie review and rating web application that gives users the ability to discover, search, review, and rate movies. While everyone can access the homepage, users must sign up or log in to search for movies, write reviews, leave star ratings, and view their review history.

Now when you search for movies like "Avatar", "Spider-Man", "Batman", "Dune", or any other popular film, you'll find them in the database. The search works by title, director, or genre, so you can search broadly (like "Action" or "Sci-Fi") or specifically by movie name.
